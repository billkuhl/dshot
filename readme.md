This is the repository for an ongoing project to create a flight controller using a Teensyduino 4.0.

The end goal is to retrieve telemetry data for use in Autonomous drones and flight systems.

The currennt state of the system gets 1000Hz telemetry data from the third wire of the ESC over UART.

The most current working file is ./final\ run/dshot_cotroller/dshot_controller.ino
